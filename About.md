#Frehley

Frehley is a minimal text editor based on Atom-Shell and the Ace Editor library

##Changelog

2 September 2014

- Update Ace to the latest build

25 June 2014

- Started adding infrastructure for a Start Page that has a recent files list. This
  is not finished but it proves that I need to stop what I'm doing and start using
  something like KnockoutJS in order to manage my UI / Model state better.

24 June 2014

- Code cleanup, remove tiny one liner functions and just inline their code at the
  places they are being used.

22 June 2014

- Port Frehley from Node-Webkit and Clojurescript to Atom-Shell and Javascript. The
  port is complete but there still may be issues remaining that need fixed up.
